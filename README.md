# wismog
Wismog is a program to create more signs with th sound card.
Alsa must be included:

#include <alsa/asoundlib.h>
#include <alsa/pcm.h>

Attention! It could be loud!
After i went for a walk (easter 2010), i had a collision with a car. 
I had a  temporal bone fracture lost my left vestibular system and 
became hard of hearing.

It is written for gernam language. But it can create greekand french 
characters, umlaut like ö,ä,ü, numbers, punctuation marks.
