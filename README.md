# wismog
Wismog is a program to create morse signs with the sound card.
Alsa must be included:

#include <alsa/asoundlib.h>

Attention! It could be loud!
After i went for a walk (easter 2010), i had a collision with a car. 
I had a  temporal bone fracture lost my left vestibular system and 
became hard of hearing.

It is written for geman language. But it can create greek and french 
characters, umlauts like ö,ä,ü, numbers, punctuation marks.
